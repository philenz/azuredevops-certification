### GitHub Actions
* GitHub actions provide task automation and workflow functionality in a repository.
* Actions can be used to streamline processes in your software development lifecycle and implement CI/CD.
* GitHub Actions are composed of the following components:
    * `Workflows`: Automated processes added to your repository.
    * `Events`: An activity that triggers a workflow.
    * `Jobs`: A set of steps that execute on a runner.
    * `Steps`: A task that can run one or more commands (actions).
    * `Actions`: Standalone commands that can be combined into steps. Multiple steps can be combined to create a job.
    * `Runners`: Server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed.

### GitHub Pages
* GitHub Pages is a hosting engine that's built right into your GitHub account.
* By following a few conventions, and enabling the feature, you can build your own static site generated from HTML and markdown code pulled directly from your repository.
