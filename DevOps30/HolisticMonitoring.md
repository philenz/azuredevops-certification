* You were asked to design a monitoring strategy that covers all solutions that your organization uses.
* Your strategy needed to provide insights and alerts for collected log and metric data.
* Your strategy also had to ensure that the organization could quickly identify and minimize the performance problems and failures.
* You've seen how to use `Azure Monitor` and its features such as `Application Insights` and `virtual machine insights` can monitor the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure.
* You have also seen how to use `Azure Security Center` and `Azure Sentinel` to monitor the security of your machines and other infrastructure resources.
* Without `Azure Monitor`, you couldn't analyze and address issues that affect the health and performance of your environment â€“ and query to analyze data in a single location.
* Without `Security Center`, you couldn't identify and address risks to your security posture. Without Sentinel, you wouldn't have security incident management, investigation, and response capabilities.
* By using the various services on Azure, you can take a full stack approach to monitoring applications and infrastructure.
* You can address issues faster and more effectively. As a result, your organization becomes more secure, productive, cost-effective, and competitive.
