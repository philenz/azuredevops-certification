* In this module, you implemented a CI solution using GitHub Actions and workflows.
* You can now:
    - Build and test a Node.js project by using `GitHub Actions and a templated workflow`
    - Debug a failed test using the GitHub Actions log
    - Customize your workflow with GitHub Actions to:
        - create a build artifact and save it
        - get access to your build artifacts
        - test against multiple targets
        - add labels your pull requests
* Next steps
    - Use GitHub Actions in `continuous delivery`
    - implement `infrastructure as code`
