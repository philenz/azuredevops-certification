* In this module, you learned how to collaborate with others by using Git and GitHub
* Implement a system that will...
    1. allow better team collaboration
    1. help ensure that only quality code is merged to the main branch
* A `build badge` and `dashboard widgets` help the team and others understand the state of the latest build and track the build history over time
* Setting up a rule on GitHub to require a review is a good way to enforce a disciplined code review practice
* Even minor errors can cause a build to break
* As an example, you watched a typing error make its way through the build and into the hands of the QA team
