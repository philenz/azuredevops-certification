- In this module, we used the Application Insights SDK to generate custom event telemetry from our video web app. We...
    - added a reference to the SDK to our project,
    - configured the environment,
    - initialized the SDK in code,
    - and used TrackEvent() to track a custom, domain-specific event.
- This is a powerful tool that will allow you to track events and gain insights into your application usage.
